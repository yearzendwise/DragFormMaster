# NPM Publishing Configuration Report

## Current Status

The project has two different package structures:

1. **Root package** (`/package.json`):
   - Name: `drag-form-master`
   - Main: `lib/index.ts` (incorrect - points to TypeScript source)
   - This appears to be the full application (client + server)

2. **Library package** (`/lib/package.json`):
   - Name: `@replit/form-builder`
   - Main: `dist/index.js` (correct)
   - This is set up to be the npm package

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues:

1. **Incorrect imports in `/lib/index.ts`**:
   - Currently imports from `../client/src/` which won't exist when published
   - These files need to be copied to the lib directory or the structure needs to be reorganized

2. **Missing LICENSE file in lib directory**:
   - Created LICENSE in root, but lib directory needs its own for npm publishing

### Recommendations:

## Option 1: Publish from lib directory (Recommended)

The lib directory is already set up for npm publishing. To fix:

1. Copy necessary components from client/src to lib/components
2. Update lib/index.ts to import from local paths
3. Copy LICENSE to lib directory
4. Run build script in lib directory
5. Publish from lib directory using `npm publish`

```bash
cd lib
npm install
npm run build
npm publish
```

## Option 2: Restructure for root publishing

If you want to publish from root:

1. Update root package.json:
   - Change main to point to built files: `"main": "dist/index.js"`
   - Add proper files field: `"files": ["dist", "LICENSE", "README.md"]`
   - Add build script for library
   - Remove server-specific dependencies or move to devDependencies

2. Create a proper build process that:
   - Builds only the form builder components
   - Excludes server code
   - Generates type definitions

## Current lib package.json is well-configured with:
- ✅ Proper name (@replit/form-builder)
- ✅ Correct entry points (main, module, types)
- ✅ Files field specifying what to publish
- ✅ Peer dependencies for React
- ✅ Build scripts using Rollup
- ✅ All necessary dependencies

## Next Steps:

1. Decide which approach to use (lib directory vs root)
2. Fix the import paths in lib/index.ts
3. Ensure all exported components are available in the lib directory
4. Test the build process
5. Consider updating the package name if not publishing under @replit scope
